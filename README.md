# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server
`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

## Functionality

This project showcases the following functionality and features:

- API Endpoints: Supports subset of CRUD operations for creating, managing, and deleting users and clothing items
- Data Storage: MongoDB used to store non-relational data for users and clothing items

## Technologies

- Node.js and Express.js: Used to build server, API endpoints
- Mongo DB: NOSQL data storage used for clothing items and users
- Postman: used to test API calls

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
